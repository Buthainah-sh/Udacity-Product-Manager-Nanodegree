1.Pitch a Product Vision:

In this project, I led the development of a product vision by addressing key business case elements. I identified problems, calculated market potential (TAM), defined target users and use cases, calculated ROI, and set success metrics. I analyzed competitor features to position our product advantageously and crafted a compelling strategy and roadmap. This approach laid a solid foundation for our product's success.

2.Run a Design Sprint:

In the second stage, I laid the groundwork with a Product Requirements Document (PRD), clarifying the problem, goals, and opportunities. We fostered understanding through a "How Might We" exercise, selecting a theme for further exploration. I envisioned user responses with a future press review and defined success metrics. Sketching and prototyping helped refine ideas, culminating in user studies to validate our concept.

3.Manage the Product Development Process:

In the third stage, I created a project blueprint, defined tasks and milestones, and prepared for sprint meetings by setting goals and organizing backlogs. I decoded API documentation, prioritized tasks, and handled potentially difficult situations, ensuring smooth project progress.

4.Deliver a Product to Market:

In the final stage, I developed a Launch Plan by updating the PRD with product and market information, identifying competitors, and crafting marketing and pricing strategies. I prepared for launch by creating checklists, mitigating risks, and training sales and support teams. Post-launch, I wrote a launch email, analyzed data, proposed solutions, and designed A/B tests. This ensured a structured approach towards a successful product launch.
